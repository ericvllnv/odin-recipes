        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
            <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
            <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
            <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
            <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
        </ol>
